/*
* Task:
*	Input: a whole number
*	Output: boolean - if a number is divisble by 3 without using the % operator
* Approach:
*	Divide the number by 3. Multiple the result by 3. Check if the two numbers are equal.
*	Question for you - why does this work?
* Additional Notes:
*	This is only one approach to this problem. There are multiple possible correct solutions.
